F2020050815,"For the EHP Field Operations SOP project:1)	Drafting, editing, updating, and maintaining EHP Field Operations Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for EHP leadership and specialists to conduct EHP operations in the field (e.g. at Joint Field Offices).  The SOPs will contain standard operating procedures, job aids, tools (e.g. checklists, excel sheets, SharePoint sites), templates, and sample materials. Tasks will include drafting and publishing new documents to a SharePoint site as well as updating existing documents and republishing those to a SharePoint site. Existing SOP chapters that shall require maintenance (i.e. updates and quality control) by the contractor include: Orientation to the JFO; Briefings and Reports; Staffing; Training, EHP Management; Position Task Guides; Data Collection; Review and Documentation (Public Assistance and Individual Assistance); Transition to Region.  Existing chapter narratives are approximately 18 pages and existing job aids are approximately 5 pages.  There can be approximately (not definite) 5-10 job aids per chapter. This includes approximately 3 job aids per chapter that are linked to each chapter from existing, approved materials. It is expected new chapters will be the same length, or shorter.2)	Potential new (in addition to maintenance of existing modules) SOP modules are listed below.  Modules include narrative documents plus associated job aids in various forms including word documents, pdfs, excel sheets, templates, use of SharePoint platforms such as Libraries. These module titles are potential topics only. Any final SOP modules at the time the contract begins will also focus on EHP incident management topics.a.	EHP Review and Documentation Chapter updates.  The Review and Documentation chapter outlines the procedural steps for reviewing FEMA projects for compliance with environmental and historic preservation laws and executive orders.b.	EHP Review and Documentation for Logistics (including Response activities).c.	Job Aids by FEMA Program.  These job aids would organize guidance available in other materials for a specialist to focus on specific EHP guidance for a program, e.g. Public Assistance Program, Individual Assistance Program.d.	Communication guide. A guide outlining communication protocols for internal and external communications and correspondence, to include links to letter templates, DHS/FEMA style guides, and drafting of communication/correspondence procedures where necessary.e.	Position Task Guide Chapter, with Job Aids by EHP position.  Tasks will be outlined in chronological order.  Positions include environmental specialist job aid, historic preservation specialist job aid, compliance review specialist job aid, and environmental floodplain specialist job aid.  Some of these drafts may be in progress or completed when the contract period of performance begins.f.	Updates to Data Collection Chapter, including data collections strategies and procedures for using documentation databases (e.g. EMIS, Grants Manager); tools for data collection.g.	GIS Chapter, including procedures for obtaining and using approved GIS tools for EHP purposes. h.

An organized, and importantly, chronological procedure for both EHP field management and field specialists.  The guidance will include many links to other completed chapters in the SOP.3)	Maintenance:  In addition to drafting new material, maintenance duties for SOP documents and SharePoint site will be needed, including checking published documents for needed procedural updates, correcting broken or incorrect links, formatting the updated SOP documents, and publishing them on the SOP SharePoint site.   Formatting documents includes making documents 508 compliant prior to publishing.4)	Editing, updating, and maintaining a SharePoint based portal for the EHP SOP materials.  This includes developing SharePoint site design features and links and webparts and adding new SharePoint features as needed.  This SharePoint site is separate from the EHP Reference Library SharePoint site (see number 6 below) but the contractor shall advise, develop, edit, and manage additional connections between the two sites. The EHP SOP will refer to and link to the EHP Reference Library where appropriate.  This effort includes maintaining SOP and EHP Reference Library materials, providing new links, and updating existing links in previously published materials. EHP Reference Library:5)	EHP Reference Library.  Each Reference Library module typically contains an Overview (tailored to FEMA) of legal requirements, links to the complete text of the statute and relevant regulations, guidance from the responsible agency, and a mix of other documents including FEMA EHP guidance, templates, and example documents.  So far, there are approximately 32 topical modules in the EHP Reference Library.  While most modules are specific to one or two EHP requirements, there are a few modules that are cross-cutting, such as one summarizing selected aspects of Interagency Collaboration.  In addition, there are approximately six modules that address different aspects of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and agency implementing procedures. Most modules include a single summary document titled âOverview,â which includes narrative descriptions customized to address FEMAâs experience with the EHP requirements.  A list of references (also described as âresourcesâ) at the end of each Overview identifies related documents and links.  The references listed are also available as links or PDFs within the Reference Library SharePoint site.  New or substantially revised content for the Reference Library undergoes careful review by multiple FEMA reviewers (and cognizant agency representatives); this process is streamlined for non-substantive changes, e.g., to links.  See Task 12 and other Tasks in the EHP Reference Library section.6)	Contractors shall maintain, edit, update, and expand the SharePoint-based EHP Reference Library. This will include developing new narrative content, editing narrative content, file maintenance, identifying and advising on additional materials to post, and maintenance and enhancement of EHP Reference Library SharePoint platform, including designing and implementing approaches for posting additional content on approximately three new nodes or SharePoint subpages. In addition, contractors shall prepare approximately 1 full-length PowerPoint presentation, and, upon request, a few other slides associated with the EHP Reference Library for occasional meetings.7)	The EHP Reference Library tasks will be less than and not exceed 50% of the contract. The average length of an EHP Reference Library module is considerably shorter than the average EHP SOP module.  Not including references, the average length of the first, existing, 24 EHP Reference Library modules is 3-4 pages. Some modules are longer, particularly some of the modules added subsequently related to NEPA implementation and modules covering some aspects of multiple laws.8)	Elements Applicable to the EHP SOP and the EHP Reference Librarya.	The work plan and project management plan for the EHP Field Operations SOP will be reviewed and approved by the Readiness Branch in OEHP.  The work plan and project management plan for the EHP Reference Library will be reviewed and approved by the Policy Branch in OEHP.  b.	The project work will include and require in person as well as remote contractor support at FEMA HQ.c.	Contractors will be provided EHP specific terms in order to write, edit and format documents; knowledge of general EHP compliance requirements is more efficient and preferred.d.	OEHP will identify at the start of the contract any specific needs it anticipates for project work phases. FEMA reserves the right to change the order of the rollout and finalization of any of the modules, topical areas, or functional areas of these sets of documents at any time during the contract period of performance.  FEMA may change the rollout schedule due to challenges associated with catastrophic disasters, deployment/reassignment/vacancies in its key positions for implementing the contract, or other reasons that warrants reprioritizing and rearranging the schedule of functional areas of modules.  Should FEMA decide to rearrange the order of document drafting, formatting, comment adjudication, and/or rollout schedule, the contractor will be notified immediately.1.3	OBJECTIVE The goals of the EHP SOP and EHP Reference Library projects is to provide and maintain a central, organized, and easily accessible repository of resources with incident management standard operating procedures, job aids, and reference resources that will support EHP compliance, promote national standard practices, and increase timeliness and efficiency of the FEMA EHP review process.This set of resources offers the following benefits to FEMA EHP field operations across all 10 FEMA Regions:1)	At the national level, standardizes and formalizes processes used by EHP staff in the field and expedites compliance with all relevant EHP requirements.2)	Offers standards, tools, policy and guidance for EHP staff responsible for incident management and project reviews, including managing an EHP operation, guidance for conducting all the steps of the NEPA process, as well as processes required under other EHP requirements, including agency directives. 3)	Provides a central, organized, and easily accessible source of EHP SOPs, policy, reference materials, guidance, and documentation to support EHP management in the field and compliance reviews.4)	Ensures the EHP field staff has up to date and ready access to all relevant policy and guidance documents necessary to make EHP compliance decisions.5)	Greater consistency and improved ability to coordinate on EHP reviews.6)	Increased efficiency of Agency staff and reduced costs.7)	Centralized location to assist in training and orienting new staff.8)	Quicker resolution of critical or urgent decisions.9)	Better informed decision making.",REC,FEMA,541620,WOSB,"$250,000.00 to $500,000.00",Order,PotomacWave,"70FA2018A00000004, 70FA5019F00000159",2020-09-24,2020-06-30,Q4 2020,Nailah  Banks,202-320-4203,nailah.banks@fema.dhs.gov,19-Jun-2020
